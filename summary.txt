From this analysis after Building the model based on the Summary we can see that
categorical variables
 1)Seasons -Fall has negative impact, -Winter has Positive impact.
 2)Year has Positive impact
 3)Month -July has negative impact, -September has positive impact.
 4)WeatherSit -Light has negative impact
 5) Other categories has no much effect on the resultant.

*It is important to use drop_first=True during dummy
variable creationso that it wont create any variation in the implementation of
code.It reduces time and steps for building the model.
So droping it benifies us with same value of having that particular
dropped variable.Also It reduces the correlations created among dummy variables.

*Looking at the pair-plot among the numerical variables, Feeling temperature in Celsius(atemp) has the highest correlation
with the target variable.

Note:-Assumptions of Linear Regression
    *Error terms should be normally distributed
    *There should be insignificant multi-collinearity among variables.
    *Linearity should be visible among variables
    *There should be no visible pattern in residual values.
    *Independence of residuals

*So Based on the final model Temp, Sep and Winter are the top 3 features
contributing significantly towards explaining the demand of the
shared bikes.
